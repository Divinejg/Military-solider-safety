## **Project Title:**

**Smart Soldier Safety and Weapon Detection System Using YOLO and Computer Vision**

---

## **Project Description:**

This project aims to enhance **military personnel safety and surveillance** by leveraging **computer vision techniques**, particularly the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The system is designed to detect **weapons** in real-time video streams, monitor **soldier activity**, and send alerts to command units in case of threats.

Using **YOLOv5**, the model is trained to accurately recognize and locate firearms, knives, and other potential threats in dynamic environments like combat zones or restricted military areas. Real-time video feeds from drones, CCTV, or body-worn cameras are processed through **OpenCV**, and the detection results are displayed using a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface.

This solution is highly relevant in **military and defense domains**, where fast and accurate detection of weapons can save lives and help commanders make data-driven decisions.

## **Key Features:**

* **Real-time weapon detection** using YOLO and OpenCV.
* **Streamlit dashboard** for live video feed visualization and threat alerts.
* **Integration with soldier-worn cameras** for continuous monitoring.
* **Custom-trained YOLO model** on weapon datasets for improved accuracy.
* **Alert system** with detection timestamps and bounding box visuals.
